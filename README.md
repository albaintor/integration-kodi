# LG TV integration for Remote Two

Using [pykodi](https://github.com/OnFreund/PyKodi)
and [uc-integration-api](https://github.com/aitatoi/integration-python-library)

The driver discovers KODI's instances on the network. A media player entity is exposed to the core.

Supported attributes:
- State (on, off, playing, paused, unknown)
- Title
- Artwork
- Source


Supported commands:
- Turn on
- Turn off
- Direction pad and enter
- Back
- Next
- Previous
- Volume up
- Volume down
- Pause / Play
- Input select
- Channels Up/Down
- Menus (home, context, settings)
- Colored buttons
- Digit numbers
- Subtitle/audio language switching

## Usage

### Setup

- Requires Python 3.11
- Under a virtual environment : the driver has to be run in host mode and not bridge mode, otherwise the turn on function won't work (a magic packet has to be sent through network and it won't reach it under bridge mode)
- Enable always on on your LG TV to be able to power on lan
- Install required libraries:  
  (using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended)

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For running a separate integration driver on your network for Remote Two, the configuration in file
[driver.json](driver.json) needs to be changed:

- Set `driver_id` to a unique value, `uc_sony_driver` is already used for the embedded driver in the firmware.
- Change `name` to easily identify the driver for discovery & setup with Remote Two or the web-configurator.
- Optionally add a `"port": 8090` field for the WebSocket server listening port.
    - Default port: `9090`
    - Also overrideable with environment variable `UC_INTEGRATION_HTTP_PORT`

### Run

```shell
python3 intg-sonyavr/driver.py
```

See
available [environment variables](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-python-library#environment-variables)
in the Python integration library to control certain runtime features like listening interface and configuration
directory.

## Build self-contained binary for Remote Two

After some tests, turns out python stuff on embedded is a nightmare. So we're better off creating a single binary file
that has everything in it.

To do that, we need to compile it on the target architecture as `pyinstaller` does not support cross compilation.

### x86-64 Linux

On x86-64 Linux we need Qemu to emulate the aarch64 target platform:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```

Run pyinstaller:

```shell
docker run --rm --name builder \
    --platform=aarch64 \
    --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v "$PWD":/workspace \
    docker.io/unfoldedcircle/r2-pyinstaller:3.11.6  \
    bash -c \
      "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && \
      pyinstaller --clean --onefile --name intg-sonyavr intg-sonyavr/driver.py"
```

### aarch64 Linux / Mac

On an aarch64 host platform, the build image can be run directly (and much faster):

```shell
docker run --rm --name builder \
    --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v "$PWD":/workspace \
    docker.io/unfoldedcircle/r2-pyinstaller:3.11.6  \
    bash -c \
      "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && \
      pyinstaller --clean --onefile --name intg-sonyavr intg-sonyavr/driver.py"
```
